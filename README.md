# Create Using HTML Canvas 
The main concepts is to mave firstly a ball by draw a circle using some canvas methods. Secondly I create a animation that can move the ball in (x,y) axis, by increment the size of x-position ball and y-position ball, by using an update function that call a `requestAnimationFrame` method. Finally I make a mouse event that gonna create a ball for each click on the screen, by using the start position-x and position-y from the mouse event `e.clientX` and `e.clientY`.
